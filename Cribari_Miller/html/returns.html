			<h1> Beast's Return Policy </h1>
			
			<p> 
			Beast Apparel takes a lot of pride in the items we create for our customers. 
			We believe that all customers should be 100 percent satisfied with their product. 
			Any customer not satisfied with their product can return the product with thirty days, 
			no questions asked, provided they have proof of purchase. By doing this we hope our customers
			can shop online with confidence. <br>
			
			<h2> F.A.Q.'s</h2>
			<h3> How do I return an order I am not satisfied with? </h3>
			<h4> There are 2 return options </h4>
			
			<ul id="returnOptions">
				<li> Online return </li>
					<p> For an online return, simply email us at beastapparel406@gmail.com and explain a reason for return.
						Our representatives will contact you with a return label. Place the return label on any box that is intact and 
						and add a return address. Drop the box off at local post office with a note specifying a refund or an exchange 
						a certain product. Once our representatives receive the package we will either give a full refund or exchange for 
						the desired product. 
					</p>
				<li> Store Return </li>
					<p> Simply take your undesired item to the nearest store location 
					(click on our store locations tab to find the closest location)
					 with proof of purchase and our representatives will take care of your
					  request to ensure a hassle free return process.
					</p>
				</ul>
				
			<h3> How much money am I going to have to pay for return shipping? </h3> 
			<p> All return shipping costs are covered by the company. 
			Once a label is printed it can be dropped off at a post office ready to ship.
			</p>
			
			<h3> What if I have held on to my package for longer than 30 days? </h3>
			<p> If you can provide proof of purchase and tags are still present, returns will 
			be accepted at representatives discretion. 
			</p>
